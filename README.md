# automatetheboringstuffwithpython--MyAnswers
My humble solutions to the problems from the book AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF WITH PYTHON 2ND EDITION by Al Sweigart.

Why ? 

I use this repository as a way to save my answers and should not be used for anything else. 

What ? 

These solutions are not optimized, they may not even be finished solutions to some problems.
